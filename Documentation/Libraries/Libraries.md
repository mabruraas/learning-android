# Google Map API

https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-java

## Description
Use Java? Want to geocode something? Looking for directions? Maybe matrices of directions? This library brings the Google Maps API Web Services to your server-side Java application. Analytics

The Java Client for Google Maps Services is a Java Client library for the following Google Maps APIs:

Directions API
Distance Matrix API
Elevation API
Geocoding API
Places API
Roads API
Time Zone API
Keep in mind that the same terms and conditions apply to usage of the APIs when they're accessed through this library.

Note: The Java Client for Google Maps Services is for use in server applications. If you're building a mobile application, you will need to introduce a proxy server to act as intermediary between your mobile application and the Google Maps API Web Services. 
The Java Client for Google Maps Services would make an excellent choice as the basis for such a proxy server.

## Description

AirTube is an easy to use networking library for Android and Java creating a distributed peer-to-peer overlay mesh network with service discovery and asynchronous message-oriented end-to-end connectivity. By combining these three main features into a small and dedicated library, AirTube frees application developers from worrying about networking details like topologies, IP addresses and port numbers, and simply lets them discover "services" and receive data from it, be it local, remote or anywhere in the global AirTube overlay mesh "cloud".
Allthough AirTube is a generic networking library for Java, it is optimized for Android mobile devices and the transmission of real-time multimedia data like streaming audio and video.
AirTube is an Open Souce project and licensed under the LGPL.
